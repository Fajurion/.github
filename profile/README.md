## Fajurion Open Source
This is the official repository of Fajurion Open Source. We develop various different apps with the goal of giving people
an alternative to paid software as well as to offer free educational software such as the Learn project.

## Current projects
The current and biggest project yet is Learn, a open-source learn platform, for better education. The default version is
currently available in German. We'll eventually offer a englisch version of the software.
