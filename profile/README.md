## Fajurion Open Source
This is the official repository of Fajurion Open Source. We develop apps that work together nicely on top of our account system.

## Current projects
We are going for projects all across the web, like our chat app which is end-to-end encrypted and will hopefully release at the end of 2023. We are also working on a MMO kind of game where everyone is in the same world, some exciting stuff, but that'll of course take a lot of time. You can look at our progress in the public repositories for our voice chat (voice node + voice client)
