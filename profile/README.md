## All of the apps and packages in this organization are no longer maintained

Fajurion used to be an attempt to create open-source apps that don't suck. That's what everyone is trying to do right? But since there aren't any contributions anywhere on this organization or projects have been migrated away, I decided to put this little reminder here.

Most of the projects here continue to live in the new [Liphium organization](https://github.com/Liphium) where the goal is to build a chat app that can finally compete with Discord. Huge goal, years of work, but I will see this through.
